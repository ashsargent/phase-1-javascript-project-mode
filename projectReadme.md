## introduction 

HelloWorld! 

welcome to the readme of my project the aim for this project was to create a simple project that showcased my knowlege with html css and javascript.


## the goal 

the goal was to create a simple workout generator with 4 categories: weights, HIIT, chill out (meditation) & stretching. 

we will use a simple one page nterface to maximize user experience, using pop up modal's to give reference pictures and descriptions with the option for the user to click to move through to the next part of the workout. With the exception of the chill out which will have a modal with an embedded youtube video. 

## API intergration

to tick the box of intergrating to an api we have embedded a search bar into the  page to locate nearby locations to visit for a workout (eg gym outdoor park etc).
